# Connect4 Game

Connect Four is a classic two-player connection game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping one of their colored discs from the top into a vertically suspended grid. The grid is typically 6 rows by 7 columns. The objective of the game is to connect four of one's own discs of the same color in a row, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, before the opponent.

In this project you will find 4-connect game implementation with a player vs bot and bot vs bot functionality. The backend is built using Flask, and the frontend is developed using React. The game employs the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning and incorporates heuristics for optimal decision-making.


## Features

- Player vs Bot gameplay
- Bot vs Bot simulation
- Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning
- Heuristic evaluation for efficient decision-making
